# TODO: Build the KiddyCode Compiler

## Overview
We need to build a Compiler for KiddyCode that can lexically analyze, parse, and emit IL for the CoreCLR. The Compiler will be written in C# targeting .NET 9.

## Steps to Build the Compiler

1. **Setup Project Structure**
   - Create a new C# project targeting .NET 9
   - Organize folders for Lexer, Parser, Syntax Tree, Analyzer, and IL Emitter

2. **Lexer**
   - Define token types (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, etc.)
   - Implement the Lexer to convert source code into tokens
   - Write unit tests for the Lexer

3. **Parser**
   - Define grammar rules for KiddyCode
   - Implement the Parser to convert tokens into a syntax tree
   - Write unit tests for the Parser

4. **Syntax Tree**
   - Define classes for different syntax tree nodes (e.g., ProgramNode, CommandNode, IfNode, etc.)
   - Implement methods to build and traverse the syntax tree
   - Write unit tests for the syntax tree

5. **Analyzer**
   - Implement semantic analysis to check for errors (e.g., type checking, scope resolution)
   - Write unit tests for the Analyzer

6. **IL Emitter**
   - Implement the IL Emitter to convert the syntax tree into IL code
   - Write unit tests for the IL Emitter

7. **Integration**
   - Integrate all components (Lexer, Parser, Analyzer, IL Emitter) into the Compiler
   - Write end-to-end tests to ensure the Compiler works correctly

8. **Documentation**
   - Document the Compiler's architecture and design
   - Provide usage instructions and examples

9. **Optimization (Optional)**
   - Implement optimizations to improve the performance of the generated IL code

## Additional Considerations
- Error handling and reporting
- Support for debugging and diagnostics
- Extensibility for future language features

## Resources
- .NET 9 documentation
- CoreCLR and IL documentation
- Compiler design books and articles

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: Setup Project Structure and Implement Lexer
- Week 3-4: Implement Parser and Syntax Tree
- Week 5-6: Implement Analyzer and IL Emitter
- Week 7-8: Integration, Testing, and Documentation

Let's get started on building an awesome Compiler for KiddyCode! ðŸš€
